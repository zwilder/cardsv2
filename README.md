# Cards! V2

![Title](Title.png)

A second attempt at a deck of cards, and some games to play with them. The first
attempt happened by accident while playing around with some terminal codes in an
attempt to do away with NCurses. This attempt is more deliberate, and will
(hopefully) at least include a playable version of Klondike (or Freecell, or
Penguin... or maybe all three?).
